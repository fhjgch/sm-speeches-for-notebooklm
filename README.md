# sm-speeches-for-notebooklm
Shri Mataji's speeches split in 50 pdfs to be uploaded to NotebookLM.
On Amruta you can find a pdf containing all ~3000 speeches transcribed in English ([Link](https://www.amruta.org/transcripts-and-translations/)). Unfortunately, the file is too big to upload to NotebookLM, which is why it's necessary to split it up into multiple files.

## Instructions
- Clone this repository (or download the files)
- Go to `notebooklm.google.com`
- Log in with your google account
- Create a new notebook
- Find the section where you can upload your sources and add the 50 pdfs from this repository
- Start asking questions!
